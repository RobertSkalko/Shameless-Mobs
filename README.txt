This is a small and simple mod, my intention is to make mobs harder and remove things I consider cheese, like mob farms.

Features (all can be disabled/configured):
* anti mob farm (prevents spawns in chunks where too many spawn per x amount of minutes)
* fire resistant mobs (no longer burn in daylight, no longer avoid lava)
* fall resistant mobs
